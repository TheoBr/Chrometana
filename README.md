BROKEN UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
------------
[Recent changes](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/28/delivering-personalized-search-experiences-in-windows-10-through-cortana/) to Windows 10 prevent Cortana from opening any browser other than Edge. Due to such, Chrometana will not be able to work.

INTRODUCTION
